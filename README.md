# 🏠 Housing Price Prediction
Predicting housing prices using machine learning models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and more. The dataset is preprocessed, and multiple regression models are evaluated to determine the best-performing model.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Dataset Name:** Housing Price Dataset  
- **Number of Records:** _Mention total rows and columns_  
- **Features:** Square footage, location, number of rooms, etc.  
- **Target Variable:** `Price`  

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy (Data Manipulation)  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)  
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost (Modeling)  
- GridSearchCV (Hyperparameter Tuning)  

## 📊 Modeling Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, outliers, feature scaling.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Correlation heatmaps, distributions.  
3. **Feature Engineering:** Transforming and selecting features.  
4. **Model Training & Evaluation:**  
   - **Linear Regression**  
   - **Random Forest Regressor**  
   - **XGBoost Regressor**  
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.  
6. **Performance Metrics:**  
   - R² Score  
   - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)  
   - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
